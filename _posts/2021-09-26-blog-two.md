 The main point of the article, *Gibbon’s Geographical Scholarship*, is to convey the importance of **geography** in Gibbon’s work. Gibbon learned from Locke to not “read” but rather learn geography with the “eye” and observing geographical maps for use in historical data analysis.  

Gibbon believed maps presented a great visual way of learning for children. And it also seemed that he was obsessed with geography books as the article mentions that  one of his library sections was filled with geography contents.  


Gibbon heavily used his geographical scholarship in decline and fall and built his idea from the geography books he owned in his library. He also applied geographical maps to estimate length and get perspective of distance(“space”) from place to place.  

In *decline and fall*, and his other publications, his use of his **geographical scholarship** gave him credibility/authority as a historian and to support his writing using geographical evidence.


The article mentions many writers of geographical books to show how Gibbon used many of them as a source in his *decline and fall* and other publications.

By using python to classify the people and places/map being mentioned and the books to understand the type of work they contributed as it relates to Gibbon’s work.


He talks about space as a reference of distance/location between places. WE can convey space using modern day maps/google maps and using algorithms to more generally understand.
